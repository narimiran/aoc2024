# Advent of Code 2024


## Not my first rodeo

I'm really passionate about Advent of Code and each year I try to do something different
and/or use different language(s).
Take a look:

* [AoC 2015 in Nim, Python](https://github.com/narimiran/advent_of_code_2015)
* [AoC 2016 in Python, Clojure (+ visualizations)](https://github.com/narimiran/advent_of_code_2016)
* [AoC 2017 in Nim, OCaml, Python](https://github.com/narimiran/AdventOfCode2017)
* [AoC 2018 in Nim, Python, Racket](https://github.com/narimiran/AdventOfCode2018)
* [AoC 2019 in OCaml, Python](https://github.com/narimiran/AdventOfCode2019)
* [AoC 2020 in Nim, one liner-y Python, Racket](https://github.com/narimiran/AdventOfCode2020)
* [AoC 2021 in Python, Racket](https://github.com/narimiran/AdventOfCode2021)
* [AoC 2022 in Python, Clojure](https://github.com/narimiran/AdventOfCode2022)
* [AoC 2023 in Clojure](https://github.com/narimiran/AdventOfCode2023)
* [AoC 2024 in Clojure (Clerk notebooks)](https://github.com/narimiran/aoc2024)




## Before we start

If you're new to Clojure, I wrote a
[Quick intro to Clojure](./clojure/clojure_intro) notebook.
It covers only the basics (otherwise it wouldn't be a _quick_ intro, would it?),
so feel free to read some other resources to get the feel for the language.

Every year I have a helper file with common functions that are
usually useful for AoC tasks.
This year is no exception, and now it is available as a notebook.
See [aoc.clj](./clojure/aoc).

I wanted to test the [graph traversal helper](./clojure/aoc#graph-traversal)
(if it doesn't take you to the correct part of the notebook, try hitting `F5`
or find it in the TOC),
and also to see how to write code that's "compatible" with Clerk
notebook format, i.e. easy and interesting to follow, so I solved some
previous tasks:
- [AoC 2016, Day 13](clojure/aoc2016_day13) (+ visualization)
- [AoC 2017, Day 12](clojure/aoc2017_day12)


Ok, now we're ready for...





## AoC 2024

Task  | Notebook  | Comment
---   | ---       | ---
[Day 01: Historian Hysteria](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1) | [day01.clj](clojure/day01) | Much easier than Day 1 2023. I like it!

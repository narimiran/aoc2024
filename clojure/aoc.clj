;; ## Reading input files
;;
;; The inputs are always in the `inputs/` folder,
;; named `dd` and have a `.txt` extension.
;; Let's simplify reading them:
;;
(defn read-input [file]
  (let [name (if (int? file)
               (format "%02d" file)
               file)]
    (slurp (str "inputs/" name ".txt"))))







;; ## Input parsing
;;
(defn integers
  [s & {:keys [negative?]
        :or {negative? true}}]

        (re-seq (if negative? #"-?\d+" #"\d+") s)))

(defn string->digits [s]

;; The `parse-line` is doing some heavy lifting here.\
;; The `parse-fn` parameter there is the key to the versatility:
;; it makes possible to parse all AoC inputs, either by the typical
;; functions (parsing integers, extracting integers from a line, creating a
;; vector of integers, vector of characters, splitting lines into words, or
;; keeping everything as it is) or by passing it a custom function, specially
;; crafted for the task at hand.

;; The hashed variants are used when trying to optimize for speed.

;; ## Graph traversal
;;
;; Graph traversal problems are relatively frequent in AoC,
;; but this is the first time I'm writing a pre-defined helper function
;; for them.
;; It remains to be seen how useful it'll be for specific tasks with
;; their specific needs: I feel like in the recent years the graph traversal
;; tasks always had some gotcha which made it harder to use a general algorithm,
;; rather than a specific one written for the task at hand.
;;
;; If this gets used, the implementation details will probably change,
;; depending on the specific tasks.
;; (As if the `traverse` function is not already way too long and complicated.)
;;
;; All four algorithms (`DFS`, `BFS`, `Dijkstra`, `A*`) share the same logic,
;; the difference is in a `queue` type.

;; ## Utilities
;;
;; Functions for some common AoC stuff.
;;
;; - `transpose`: We often need to iterate through columns, instead of rows.
;;   This transposes the matrix.
;; - `invert-tree`: Connections between nodes in a reverse order.
;; - `count-if`: In many tasks we need to apply some condition and then count
;;   the number of elements which satisfy it. This should be slightly faster
;;   (to type, at least) than `(count (filter ...))`.
;; - `sum-map`: Similarly, in some tasks we need to apply a function to
;;   each row, and then take a sum of the results.
;; - `find-first`: Returns the first element which satisfies a predicate.

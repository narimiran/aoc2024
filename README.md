After using Clojure (along side Python) for the first time in [2022](https://github.com/narimiran/AdventOfCode2022), I've used it exclusively in [2023](https://github.com/narimiran/AdventOfCode2023), and it'll be my main language this year.
I like it _that_ much.

To make things interesting (or at least different than the last year), this year I'll be using [Clerk notebooks](https://clerk.vision).
To make this notebook format "work", I'll have to write the code in a different way than I usually do: I'll not just present the final solution, but the whole process from reading the input and then slowly building the required blocks until we come with the solution.

The notebooks are available at: https://narimiran.github.io/aoc2024
